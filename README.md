## How To Play

*The goal of the game is for a player to accumulate 100 points first!*

**GAME RULES:**

- The game has 2 players each taking one turn, per round
- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they wish. Each result get added to their ROUND score
- If the player rolls a 1, their ROUND score gets lost and it becomes the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their TOTAL score. After that, it is the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 TOTAL points wins the game
